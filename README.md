# Rob Red's Land

### Project 3 (wdi16)

## Full MERN Stack Application

### The project evaluated my ability to use React, Node with Express, and Mongo with Mongoose for the database


**About this project**:
  - I developed an application that allows users to manage their their character and card inventory for a tading card game based on the video game series known as Borderlands.

  - Technologies and libraries I used:
    - I used **React.js, Node.js with Express, MongoDB, Mongoose** and all of the dependencies that each of those packages have
    - I also used React Router and Styled Component packages
  - In Version 2, I would like to add:
    - User authentication
    - Build on the the game aspect of the application.
    - Progressive Web App features so the cards match to a specific character in possession of that card.
    - A way for users to view the collections of flashcards with other users

  - I used different syntax in places
    - As I developed this app, I used various syntax to make sure I understood the variations. For example, in the same component or router, I used both .then and async/await versions of promises. **I understand this is not a good way to build production code**, but I wanted to use the project to improve my understanding of the syntax options. I have made comments in the code to explain my method.

  - Major takeaways:
    - **Mobile first should be considered intially**; I noticed that when I was building the application, I relied on the responsiveness to respond to the way a user might view it. Although responsive, the app might have been easier to build starting from a mobile perspective. A ctrading card is about the same size as a phone screen, if not smaller, which would make it a great candidate for a displaying a card database using an icon view for index, and full display for single showings.

    - **Systems thinking is valuable**; This is an extension of the previous takeaway. The value of applying the models from basic systems thinking to the development of complex full-stack applications cannot be overstated. The entire app is just a series of feedback loops. Once I understood the cause and effect relationships between the individual elements of the system, I was able to isolate the points of leverage, and then I could select the most efficient solution to each problem. 

    - **Reviewing previous takeaways**; Functionality should be planned instead of improvised upon building. Not being thourough enough with planning the basic user experience, the overall goal of a project can become forgotten easily by geting lost in unecessary concerns and fetaures.
